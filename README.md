There will be two phases.

Study phase This will display images one after the other in order for the subject to memorize these images. They will be presented for 1 second and no response is asked for from the subject. 25 randomly selected images will be presented (out of a folder of 51 images).

Testing phase (recall task) The subject will be presented with the images shown before as well as some images not seen before, in a randomized pattern. The task is to display images and request a response from the participant (Yes: it was in the series before, or No: It was not). Test images are presented for about 0.5 seconds or until the subjects responds with a touchkey. 10 new images + 10 old images (randomly selected from the 25 images seen in phase 1) will be shown in phase 2.

Feedback implemented in Phase 2: 
- Green square means correct.
- Red square for incorrect answer.

Accuracy implemented in Phase 2:
- if participant gets it right, accuracy = 1
- if participant does not get it right, accuracy = 0
