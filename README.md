There will be two phases.

Study phase This will display images one after the other in order for the subject to memorize these images. They will not be presented for too long (duraction of about 2 seconds) No response is asked for from the subject. The list of 'study' objects is read from the file 'studylist.txt'.

Testing phase (recall task) The subject will be presented with the images shown before as well as some images not seen before, in a randomized pattern. The task is to display images and request a response from the participant (Yes: it was in the series before, or No: It was not) the subject is presented with test images defined in the file 'testlist.txt'(in randomized order) Test images are presented for about 0.5 seconds or until the subjects responds with a touchkey.

End of Task: When all images in the 'testlist.txt' have been presented, the results will be stored to a file '...'.
